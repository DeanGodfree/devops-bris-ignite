# Ignite slides for DevOps Brisbane Meetup 02/06/2016

Basis of slides is [slides.md].

To convert slides to HTML:

```
git submodule init
make
```

Requires pandoc. The [default.revealjs] is based on the
source from pandoc, but with a couple of tweaks to pass
autoSlide timings to reveal.js and allow CSS overrides
through [overrides.css]
